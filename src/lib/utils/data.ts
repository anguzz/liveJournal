		heading: "Zedd",
		content: "Saw him in Vegas at the Omnia nightclub, sounded super great live, got a great lightshow and was at the very front like 3 feet away. Even though he started like 1:40am and I was tired it felt like he was controlling my heart bpm with how good he was. The thing that sucked was the crowd was super rude and the nightclub was sold out or oversold to the point there was no space to move around which was frustrating when trying to do anything."
